### Microservices created and implemented:

#### Catalog microservice: 
* ASP.NET Core Web API application 
* REST API (CRUD operations)
* **MongoDB database** connection and containerization
* Repository Pattern Implementation

#### Basket microservice: 
* ASP.NET Core Web API application 
* REST API (CRUD operations)
* **Redis database** connection and containerization
* Repository Pattern Implementation

#### Docker Compose establishment with all microservices on docker;
* Containerization of microservices
* Containerization of databases
* YML files configuration

> ðŸ’¡ SOLID, Clean Architecture, Domain Driven Design (DDD), Clean Code, logging, validation, exception handling, Swagger Open API and other standards/features were highly used for designing the projects.
